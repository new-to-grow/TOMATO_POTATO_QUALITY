# 🍅🥔 Tomato & Potato Disease Detection using Vision Transformer (ViT)

This project implements a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model to classify **tomatoes and potatoes as either healthy or diseased**. Trained on curated Kaggle datasets, it achieves **97.45% accuracy** and includes **Grad-CAM visualizations** to explain model predictions. Designed for **local deployment**, the app offers a user-friendly interface via Streamlit or Flask.

## 🔎 Explainable AI with Grad-CAM

This project uses **Grad-CAM** to provide **heatmaps** that show which parts of the image influenced the model's decision.

🖼️ Example:

| Original Image | Grad-CAM Heatmap |
|----------------|------------------|
| ![input](assets/example_input.jpg) | ![heatmap](assets/example_heatmap.jpg) |

> Grad-CAM allows users to **see what the model is "looking at"** when making predictions, improving trust and interpretability.
